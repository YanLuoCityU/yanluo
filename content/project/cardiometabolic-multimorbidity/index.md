**Cardiometabolic Multimorbidity and Outcomes**
-----------------
* Our team examined the associations between cardiometabolic multimorbidity and adverse health outcomes, including depressive symptoms and disability, by generalized estimation equation models among more than 20,000 Chinese adults.

**Cardiometabolic Multimorbidity Transition**
-----------------
* Our group described the transitions of cardiometabolic disease, multimorbidity, and mortality utilizing multi-state Markov models among 17,250 older patients with hypertension. In addition, we investigated the literature related to multimorbidity patterns/clusters and the network analysis in the past five years; gained expertise in the complex network and overlapping community detection.
