Multimorbidity and Frailty Transition
-----------------
I identified multimorbidity patterns using the latent class analysis and examined the association between multimorbidity patterns and dynamic frailty transitions among older American adults.

Trajectory of Multimorbidity and Frailty
-----------------
I investigated the longitudinal trajectories of multimorbidity and frailty.
