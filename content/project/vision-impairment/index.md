Our team conducted a longitudinal study has revealed a concerning rise in vision impairment among Chinaâ€™s oldest-old adults over the past two decades. Analyzing data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, We assessed vision using the Landolt-C chart and employed generalized estimating equation models incorporating a natural cubic spline to uncover nonlinear trends and contributing factors. The prevalence of vision impairment doubled from 1998 to 2011 and stabilized thereafter, with conditions like glaucoma and cataracts playing a significant role. These findings underscore the need for targeted prevention and management strategies to address this growing public health challenge.
