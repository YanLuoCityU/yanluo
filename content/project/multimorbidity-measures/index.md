Multimorbidity Index
-----------------
* I developed a multimorbidity index incorporating disease combinations identified by the association rule mining to predict mortality using the logistic regression among 11,853 older Chinese adults.  

Multimorbidity Measures Comparison
-----------------
* Our group explored multimorbidity patterns by data mining methods including the explanatory factor analysis and the group-based trajectory model. Then, we compared the performance of different multimorbidity measures in predicting mortality and disability by Cox proportional hazards models.
